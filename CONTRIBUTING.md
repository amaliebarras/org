# CONTRIBUTING.md

Let me start by saying that...

**WE ARE SO EXCITED YOU ARE HERE!**

You are on your way to some serious
civic hacking. 

A good place to start is by reading our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefordenver/codeofconduct),
if you haven't already.

When you are done with 
that come back here and let's talk about some of the tools
we use to communicate, collaborate and self-organize.

## Getting Started with CfD
