## CONTRIBUTING.md



Let me start by saying that...

**WE ARE SO EXCITED YOU ARE HERE!**

You are on your way to some serious
civic hacking. 

A good place to start is by reading our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefordenver/codeofconduct),
if you haven't already.

When you are done with 
that come back here and let's talk about some of the tools
we use to communicate, collaborate and self-organize.

1. ###Flowdock.com
	is our chat room. We use it to 
	engange with other members, share progress, ask questions. 
	Its cross platform so you can use it anywhere, you'll love it.
 
 	**Get you account by emailing codefordenver@gmail.com or by
 attending one of our meetups.**

2. ###Github.com
	is our source control solution. This is how we 
	share code between members and other brigages around the world.

	**[Get an account here](https://github.com/).**


3. ###Waffle.io
	is our light-weight project management solution. 
	A simple Kanban not unline Trello with very nice github integration.
 
 	**Once you have a github account, you should have 
 	access the waffle boards over at [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/).**
 	
 	**Do let us know if you run into any trouble.**
