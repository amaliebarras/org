## CONTRIBUTING.md



Let me start by saying that...

**WE ARE SO EXCITED YOU ARE HERE!**

You are on your way to some serious
civic hacking. 

A good place to start is by reading our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefordenver/codeofconduct),
if you haven't already.

When you are done with 
that come back here and let's talk about some of the tools
we use to communicate, collaborate and self-organize.

- **Flowdock** is our asynchronous channel. We use it to 
 engange with all members, share progress, ask questions. 
 Its cross platform so you can use it anywhere, you'll love it. 

- **Waffle** is our light-weight project management solution. 
 A much simpler Kanban then say Trello.

- **Github** is our source control solution. This is how we 
share code between members and other brigages around the world.

- **Meetup.com** is our event organizing tool. You can sign
up for upcoming civic-hack nights and other important events.
